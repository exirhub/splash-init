# ProxyFleet XUI Sync

`proxyfleet-xui-sync` synchronizes ProxyFleet's managed `TH-<number>`
outbounds with x-ui while avoiding unnecessary x-ui/Xray restarts.

It preserves all non-TH outbounds and routing rules. The configured balancer
(default: `ADMOB-BALANCER`) is created when missing; afterward, only its
selector is synchronized.

## Runtime behavior

| Detected change | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Same tags, only proxy IP/port/credentials changed | Hot-swap changed outbounds through Xray `HandlerService`; no x-ui restart |
| Feed order changed but tag set is identical | No change; tags are normalized in numeric order |
| Fresh install with no managed TH outbounds | Apply the validated non-empty Ready pool and create the balancer immediately |
| Tag added/removed, selector changed, or balancer missing on an existing pool | Wait for repeated identical observations, then perform one controlled restart |
| Xray runtime API unavailable during an endpoint-only update | Fall back to the same stability and cooldown guards before restarting |
| Hot update starts but fails | Perform one controlled restart so the database and running Xray stay consistent |

The timer checks every **10 minutes**, with up to 30 seconds of random delay.
With the default `RESTART_STABLE_RUNS=3`, a restart-requiring topology change
on an existing managed pool must therefore remain identical for roughly 30
minutes. A fresh installation has no managed TH outbounds and bootstraps on the
first successful Ready response. Ordinary endpoint changes behind fixed tags
are applied on the first check without restarting.

Hot updates use Xray's official `api rmo` and `api ado` commands. See the
[Xray command documentation](https://xtls.github.io/document/command.html).

## Safety guarantees

- Validates every downloaded tag, protocol, address and port before writing.
- Requires ProxyFleet's Ready response by default.
- Refuses an empty feed so a bad response cannot remove every managed outbound.
- Sorts `TH-<number>` tags numerically, so feed ordering cannot churn selectors.
- Uses an SQLite snapshot backup that remains consistent in WAL mode.
- Applies database changes in an immediate transaction.
- Restores the backup if a controlled restart fails.
- Uses a process lock so timer and manual runs cannot overlap.
- Rate-limits restarts with stable-observation and cooldown guards.
- Stores restart state atomically with mode `0600`.
- Supports a non-destructive dry-run.

## Fresh installation

Requirements: Linux with systemd, Python 3, Git, x-ui, and its SQLite database.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exirhub/proxyfleet-xui-sync.git
cd proxyfleet-xui-sync
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

Then configure the feed token if the endpoint requires one:

```bash
sudoedit /etc/proxyfleet-xui-sync.env
sudo systemctl start proxyfleet-xui-sync.service
```

The installer creates the environment file only on the first installation.
On later installations it preserves every existing value and appends only
new configuration keys that are missing.

## Update an existing installation

From the existing repository clone:

```bash
cd /path/to/proxyfleet-xui-sync
git pull --ff-only origin main
sudo ./install.sh
```

If the old installation directory is unknown, install a fresh copy and run
the same installer; the current `/etc/proxyfleet-xui-sync.env` is preserved:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/exirhub/proxyfleet-xui-sync.git proxyfleet-xui-sync-update
cd proxyfleet-xui-sync-update
sudo ./install.sh
```

After installing or updating, verify the timer and run one manual sync:

```bash
systemctl status proxyfleet-xui-sync.timer --no-pager
systemctl list-timers proxyfleet-xui-sync.timer
sudo systemctl start proxyfleet-xui-sync.service
journalctl -u proxyfleet-xui-sync.service -n 100 --no-pager -o cat
```

For fixed tags whose proxy endpoint changed, the success log should contain:

```text
Runtime action: Xray API hot update
```

It should not contain an x-ui restart for that run.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PROXYFLEET_OUTBOUNDS_URL` | `http://85.237.211.23:8788/outbounds` | Base64 outbounds feed |
| `PROXYFLEET_OUTBOUNDS_TOKEN` | empty | `X-Outbounds-Token` header |
| `XUI_DB` | `/etc/x-ui/x-ui.db` | x-ui SQLite database |
| `XUI_SERVICE` | `x-ui` | systemd service used for controlled restart |
| `XUI_BALANCER_TAG` | `ADMOB-BALANCER` | Managed balancer |
| `MIN_CHANGES` | `1` | Minimum managed diff before applying |
| `REQUIRE_READY` | `true` | Require ProxyFleet Ready response |
| `DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` | `25` | Feed timeout in seconds |
| `HOT_RELOAD` | `true` | Enable runtime updates for fixed tags |
| `XRAY_BINARY` | `/usr/local/x-ui/bin/xray-linux-amd64` | Xray executable with API commands |
| `XRAY_RUNTIME_CONFIG` | `/usr/local/x-ui/bin/config.json` | Running config used to discover the API listener |
| `XRAY_API_SERVER` | empty | Explicit API address, such as `127.0.0.1:10085`; empty means auto-discover |
| `XRAY_API_TIMEOUT` | `5` | Runtime API timeout in seconds |
| `RESTART_STABLE_RUNS` | `3` | Identical observations required before a restart |
| `RESTART_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `1800` | Minimum time between controlled restarts |
| `STATE_FILE` | `/var/lib/proxyfleet-xui-sync/state.json` | Persistent stability/cooldown state |
| `XUI_RESTART_WAIT_SECONDS` | `4` | Post-restart health-check wait |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION` | `10` | Backups to retain |
| `DRY_RUN` | `false` | Calculate only; do not write, hot-update, or restart |

If x-ui exposes `HandlerService` on a nonstandard API address and automatic
discovery cannot find it, set `XRAY_API_SERVER` explicitly. If the API is not
available, the synchronizer does not restart immediately: it applies the
stability and cooldown gates first.

## Operations

```bash
systemctl status proxyfleet-xui-sync.timer --no-pager
systemctl list-timers proxyfleet-xui-sync.timer
journalctl -u proxyfleet-xui-sync.service -n 100 --no-pager -o cat
sudo systemctl start proxyfleet-xui-sync.service
```

For a dry-run, temporarily set `DRY_RUN=true` in the environment file, start
the service manually, then restore it to `false`.

Backups are stored next to the configured database as
`x-ui.db.backup-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS`. The newest ten are retained by default.

## Test

The smoke tests use a local feed, temporary SQLite database, fake Xray API,
and fake systemctl executable. They never contact the production endpoint or
restart a real service.

```bash
python3 tests/smoke_test.py
```
